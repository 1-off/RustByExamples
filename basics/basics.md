# In Rust, you use the return keyword to return a value from a function. Here's an example:
```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}
```
Note that the return keyword is optional in Rust and you can simply write the expression to be returned on its own line without using return. Here's the same function without the return keyword:rustCopy codefn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
This is a common idiomatic style in Rust, and it's often referred to as an "implicit return." The last expression in the function block is automatically returned, so you can omit the return keyword.
